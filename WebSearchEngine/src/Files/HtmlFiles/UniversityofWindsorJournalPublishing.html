           <p>The <em>Journal of Teaching and Learning (JTL)</em> acknowledges the traditional territories of the Three Fires Confederacy of First Nations, comprised of the Ojibwe, the Odawa, and the Potawatomi. There are few places on earth where others have not walked before us or called it home.</p> 
           <p>The <em>JTL</em> is an international, peer-reviewed journal. The journal seeks manuscripts that provide a critical examination of education, and publishes original research that contributes to questions in teaching and learning. These may include: issues related to indigenous education, gender, class, race, ability, ethnicity and diversity, educational policy, teacher education, educational leadership, and theories of teaching and learning. The journal also welcomes novel qualitative, arts-based, non-traditional methodologies.</p> 
           <p>The <em>JTL</em> is published twice a year. Submissions are anonymously peer-reviewed.</p>

           <p>Consistent with its history and mandate and in light of previous suggestions by SSHRC, the&nbsp;<em>Yearbook&nbsp;</em>has sought to ensure that published articles move beyond doctrinal analysis of law. While analysis of legal texts and developments in legal interpretation are by no means eschewed, the Editors acknowledged the extraordinary wealth of scholarship about access to justice (rather than access to legal institutions) in the discourses of anthropology, philosophy, social history, classics and literary criticism. The Editors intend to continue efforts to tap the potential of such scholarship for the&nbsp;<em>Yearbook&nbsp;</em>and value&nbsp;papers that draw upon social science and other non-doctrinal sources of legal scholarship.</p>

           <p><strong><em>Critical Social Work</em> </strong>offers the opportunity for constructive dialogue in the interest of achieving social justice. We recognize the historical nature of both human capability and social justice. With such recognition, we do not attempt a definitive definition of either. In part the goal of <em>Critical Social Work</em> is to assist us collectively in recognizing the current potentials for social justice as well as the future possibilities. Further, we recognize that a contemporary definition of social justice must deal with the issues of legal, moral, and economic obligation of both the individual and the collective.</p> 
           <p>We propose that through dialogue there exists the possibility of refining our ideas about the individual and community, clarifying the relationship between interpersonal relations and institutional structures, and identifying actions that promote both individual and community well-being. To this end <em>Critical Social Work </em>strives, for this is surely critical social work, that is, activity directed towards establishing essential judgments in constructing a sustaining context for conviviality.</p>
