to help: clarify standards and process for new and progressing faculty members offer faculty members the best possible chance to make their case for promotion or tenure based on their unique situation, strengths, principles and practices establish decision-making processes that are clear, systematic, as consistent as possible, and also flexible enough to reflect the diversity of practice within disciplines create departmental rtp documents that reflect the level of sophistication of committee discussion ensure that departmental standards are clear to ucapt, external referees, and, should it be necessary, to external arbitrators communicate and value the effort, thought, commitment and skill that faculty bring to their scholarly responsibilities criteria overview teaching evaluation framework word version research evaluation framework word version service evaluation framework word version strategies for adapting the framework example summary document: criteria and indicators only ucapt - approved rtp criteria the following is a list of currently ucapt approved criteria for renewal, tenure, and promotion (rtp). rtp criteria are unique to each academic unit, and reflects the diversity of academic, educational, scholarly, and professional expectations within their various disciplines. rtp criteria should also outline how other important considerations relevant to rtp will be addressed, and in particular, how to provide for equity, diversity, and inclusion (edi). in developing rtp criteria, it can be helpful to refer to rtp criteria developed by cognate disciplines as a starting point. the following criteria that have been identified with an asterisk (*) are recommended as potential references for academic units that are beginning or updating their own rtp efforts. criteria identified with two asterisks (**) include significant discussion pertaining to edi. communication, media and film (approved march 1, 2021) computer science (approved june 12, 2019) (*) dramatic art (re-approved december 14, 2021) (*) dramatic art ?
