university of windsor suppliers are being targeted by malicious fraudulent emails from imposters: imposters are pretending to be employees from the university?s procurement services department, in order to contact suppliers for product quotes. once a supplier responds to the quote request email, the imposter asks for the product to be shipped to a fictitious university shipping address. the shipping address given is not a legitimate university address and is usually located in or around the greater toronto area. fraudulent attempts may include the following: fake e-mail domains: imposters will send emails from domains that look like they are coming from the university but may be spelled differently (e.g. @univwindsor.com, @uvwindsor.com). cell phone numbers as contact information for university officials: the university will always provide its main line (519-253-3000) with an extension as the first point of contact on all official documents. poorly written and unprofessional emails, with grammatical errors and bolded or coloured font. suspicious requests: imposters will request orders for large quantities of products (e.g. electronics, lab equipment, cameras, construction supplies). unrecognized shipping address: imposters will provide suppliers with shipping addresses that are not affiliated with the university in order to re-route products sent by suppliers. the imposter will likely request to open a line of credit on behalf of the university what should i do if i think i am a potential victim of procurement fraudulent activity?
