the resumption of research may 29, 2020 dear members of the uwindsor research community, over the past few weeks, the research planning working group and the critical research committee, comprising representatives from faculties, departments, and offices across our campus, have worked to develop a comprehensive framework and process for the resumption of research activities at the university of windsor. the resulting uwindsor framework for the resumption of research was approved by the university?s executive on may 29, 2020, and will take effect on monday, june 1, 2020. the uwindsor framework for the resumption of research provides a strong, yet flexible, framework that will allow our research activities to resume in a phased and coordinated manner. with an overarching principle of protecting the health and safety of our campus research community and the communities with which we conduct research, this framework and corresponding processes have been designed to function in concert with ontario?s roadmap for the reopening of the province and to reflect guidance provided by the province and the chief medical officer on strategies for continued public and workplace health and safety. the uwindsor framework for the resumption of research comprises the following phases, and allows for smooth and rapid transition between phases to accommodate changes in the escalation and/or de-escalation of the covid-19 pandemic challenge: phase 0: essential services only phase 1: critical research and essential services phase 2: critical/covid-19 and time-sensitive research phase 3: resumption of field- and lab-based research and re-opening of facilities phase 4: resumption of all research activities the university is currently in the process of transitioning from phase 1 to phase 2 of the uwindsor framework for the resumption of research, and flow and zone analysis of buildings on campus will guide the planned phasing of research activities to take place. information on the uwindsor framework for the resumption of research and the processes established for researchers planning to resume research activities are also available on on the covid-19 research and innovation guidance page of the ovpri website. please visit the site regularly for updates. please share this message with relevant students and staff in your research group. thank you once again for your
