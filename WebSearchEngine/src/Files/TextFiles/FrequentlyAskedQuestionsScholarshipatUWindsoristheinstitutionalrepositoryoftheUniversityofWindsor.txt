(you only need to modify the portion of the form that corresponds to the changes you wish to make.) { top } how can i submit a multi-part file, such as multiple chapters for a book? combine all the sections together as one microsoft word file or pdf file and submit that. to make one pdf file from multiple files, open the first pdf file, then choose document>insert pages from acrobat's menus to insert the second file (indicate it should go after the last page of the first file), and repeat for all documents. the result will be one compound pdf file which may then be submitted. if you feel that the one large pdf file might be too large for some people to download, we suggest that you submit the consolidated file as the full text of the article, and then upload the separate chapters or sections of the document as associated files. these files will appear on the web page alongside the complete document. for more information about uploading associated files, see below. { top } can i post related files (sound clips, data sets, etc.) alongside the published article? yes. the bepress system refers to these supplementary items as associated files. you will be prompted to submit associated files when you upload your submissions. the name of the files you upload will appear on the web site along with your short description of it. viewers must have the necessary software to open your files; that is not provided by the bepress system. please be sure that there are no permissions issues related to use of the associated material. sometimes, especially with images, you must write a letter seeking permission to use the material before it can be posted. also note that where possible, items such as images, charts and tables that are referenced in the document (or otherwise an integral part of the document) should be included directly in the article itself and not posted just as associated files. { top } can i post a reprint from a journal? it depends on what the journal allows, which is usually specified in their agreement with the author. if it would not violate copyright to post the reprint on your repository site, you're welcome to do so. permissions for many publishers can be found at sherpa romeo. { top } a working paper in our repository site has been published in a slightly revised form in a journal. what should i do? many journals do not have any restrictions on working papers that preceded an article, especially if substantial revisions were made. you should check your author agreement with the journal to confirm that there is no problem with leaving the working paper on the site. the repository would constitute noncommercial use. assuming the working paper does remain on posted in the repository, it is a good idea to include the citation to the published article on the cover page of the repository working paper. please contact the repository administrator to request this change. { top } search enter search terms: select context to search: in this repository across all repositories advanced search notify me via email or rss browse collections disciplines disciplines authors electronic theses and dissertations author corner author faq how to submit about open access submit research digital commons home | about | faq | my account | accessibility statement privacy copyright
