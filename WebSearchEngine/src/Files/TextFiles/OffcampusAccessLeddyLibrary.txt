durable links to library resources create bookmarks to our online resources that are durable and reliable when you want to connect to them, both on- and off-campus. shortened links from leddy library that begin with led.uwindsor.ca already contain a proxied link and will work both on campus and off. you can find these shortened links from our a to z list of online resources (e.g., http://led.uwindsor.ca/psycinfo). these shortened links are updated by our staff when there are changes to the resources. connect to the university network with a vpn access our online resources just like you are on campus by using a virtual private network (vpn) to connect to the university network while you're off-campus. a vpn provides secure remote access from your device to the university network and makes it seem as if it is on the campus network by setting up a tunnel that encrypts all traffic between your computer and the university firewall. when you visit a journal, book or database website directly, you will be identified as a uwindsor user without needing to go to the library website first. visit the campus its website for instructions on how to set up a vpn for your computer: instructions for macos instructions for windows connect with your library contact us research & reference help library hours my library account wellness blackboard manage uwin account terms and conditions emergency services for students the university of windsor is situated on the traditional territory of the three fires confederacy of first nations: the ojibwa, the odawa, and the potawatomi. follow us on twitter follow us on facebook follow us on linkedin follow us on flickr follow us on youtube follow us on instagram
