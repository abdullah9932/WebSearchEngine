he said. the students counted 56 species of birds in migration, including clouds of turkey vultures and a near-constant stream of blue jays moving south for the winter. ?this experience truly brought what we are learning in class to life,? said mikayla bornais, a second-year concurrent education student. ?seeing a migrating kingfisher hover over the water, hunting for fish, was truly breathtaking. learning about these features in a textbook or in class can be challenging and isn't nearly as impressionable.? dr. mennill said the observatory?s volunteers helped to create an outstanding learning experience, sharing their knowledge about the importance of hawk counting and bird banding. ?spending this time at holiday beach was one of the best learning experiences i've ever had,? said kevin oun, a fourth-year biology major. ?watching passionate people out in the field and taking a small part in their activities has given me a greater sense of involvement in my learning of ornithology.? classmate brenten vercruysse said the day?s activities gave him a chance to see live birds up-close, and learn how banding birds aids in understanding their migration. ?a friendly birder on the holiday beach hawk tower told our group: if you?re not having fun birding, then you?re doing something wrong,? said vercruysse. ?we definitely did it right on our trip to holiday beach? we had a lot of fun during this field expedition.? more photos from the expedition are available on mennill?s website. dan mennill kevin oun mikayla bornais brenten vercruysse strategic priority: provide an exceptional undergraduate experience academic area: science biology share tweet save external job postings mar 30, 2022 - full time lead hand - starbucks coffee shop feb 23, 2022 - graduate/ financial secretary '8' in the department of electrical & computer engineering jan 14, 2022 - facilities / equipment / events technician classification "iv" in the department of athletics & recreational services internal job postings mar 31, 2022 - work-integrated learning coordinator ?
