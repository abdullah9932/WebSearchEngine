the natural sciences and engineering research council (nserc); and the social sciences and humanities research council (sshrc). every year, the federal government invests in research excellence in the areas of health sciences, engineering, natural sciences, social sciences and humanities through its three granting agencies. the research support fund reinforces this research investment by helping institutions ensure that their federally funded research projects are conducted in world-class facilities with the best equipment and administrative support available. eligible institutions receive an annual grant through the fund to help pay for a portion of the central and departmental administrative costs related to federally funded research. the program (formerly known as the indirect costs program) was introduced in 2003 as part of the federal government?s strategy to make canada one of the world?s top countries in research and development. it currently has a budget of $369 million and serves 125 postsecondary institutions across the country. the five main expenditure areas of the research support fund are: facilities; resources; management and administration; regulatory requirements and intellectual property. research facilities; research resources; management and administration of an institution's research enterprise; regulatory requirements and accreditation; and intellectual property and knowledge mobilization. examples of costs supported by the program are: institutional support for the completion of grant and award applications/research proposals; training of faculty and research personnel for health and safety; costs related to the maintenance of libraries and laboratories; and administrative costs associated with patent applications. calculation of the research support fund grant the university of windsor's research support fund allocation is calculated based on tri-council (cihr, nserc, and sshrc) funding awarded in the previous fiscal year. in 2021-22 uwindsor received a $3.3m grant dedicated to five expenditure categories: this allocation supports central research administration and core facilities including operating expenditures, technician salaries, operation and maintenance of equipment, central administration, library costs, research planning and promotion, upgrades to facilities, training of faculty and students in research safety and biohazards, patent applications, central computing service costs and database and information system upgrades. the research support fund (rsf) is the major source of funding for infrastructure support used to attract and retain high-quality researchers to the university of windsor. our researchers depend on this support to conduct their research activities which creates research programs that are crucial to their overall research success. incremental project grants the incremental project grants (ipg) provides support additional to the research support fund which provides further support for the indirect costs of research. the ipg provides eligible institutions with additional support for projects that focus on a set of priorities that cut across the rsf?s five existing categories of eligible expenses. the initial four ipg priority areas are: innovation and commercialization activities; facilities renewal, including deferred maintenance; information resources, including digital resources, open access and databases; and equity, diversity and faculty renewal (in the context of equity, diversity and inclusion). in 2020-2021 the university of windsor received $59,173. this funding was used to provide support to uwindsor?s health research community. affiliated institutions the university of windsor does not have any affiliated institutions as defined by the research support fund. institutional performance objectives share tweet save share tweet save contact us university directory accessibility news services for media uwindsor mobile apps terms & conditions policies manage uwin account emergency services for students follow us on twitter follow us on facebook follow us on linkedin follow us on flickr follow us on youtube follow us on instagram
