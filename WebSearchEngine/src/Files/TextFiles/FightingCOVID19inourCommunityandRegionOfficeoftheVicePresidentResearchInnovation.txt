innerseasonings, maker of the tbq line of sauces; and peak processing, a local maker of edible and topical cannabis products, to provide a made-in-windsor-essex solution to the global shortage of hand sanitizer. by the beginning of april, thousands of bottles of the custom hand sanitizer formulated by dr. trant using an ethanol-based by-product of the distilling process had already been donated to police officers, nurses, and volunteers in our region. on april 3, 1,900 bottles of hand sanitizer were handed out to the community in a by-donation event that raised approximately $12,000 for the amherstburg food and fellowship mission. see the daily news stories below for more information on the hand sanitizer initiative: sanitizer formulated by uwindsor chemist gets into ? and onto ? local
