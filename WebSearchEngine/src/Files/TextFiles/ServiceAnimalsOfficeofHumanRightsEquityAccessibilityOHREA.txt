to learn how to register your service animal for accommodation with student accessibility services general behavioural expectations of service animals service animals are expected to be calm and under control while on campus. pacing, barking or whining can be disruptive to campus or classroom activities, and energetic or anxious greetings of other people can be upsetting. there are no public areas of the campus where a service animal is permitted to roam freely. at all times, service animals must be restrained by a leash or other appropriate means. owners are required to supply equipment to clean up after their service animal and dispose of waste in the appropriate receptacle. persons who are not physically able to pick up and dispose of waste are responsible for making all necessary arrangements for assistance to do so. situations where a service animal causes disruption to the campus community or damages property will be regarded the same as if the owner had directly engaged in the behaviour themselves. the cost of repairing or replacing any damaged property falls entirely to the owner of the animal. it is also the responsibility of the owner to avoid or remedy any disruptions caused by the service animal. it is highly recommended that your service animal wears some type of easily recognizable symbol (e.g. a vest or harness) that clearly identifies that they are a service animal. to learn more about personal and animal well-being, please follow the links below: personal and animal well-being at uwindsor common situations to anticipate if you meet a service
