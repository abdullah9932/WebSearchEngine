into one of the premier interuniversity athletic programs in canada. our rich tradition at the university of windsor can be attributed to all of our dedicated student-athletes, coaches, administration and friends who have helped to make the program what it is today. in 1952, assumption college, under the leadership of father hussey as moderator of athletics and dr. frank demarco as intercollegiate and intramural director, joined the ontario-quebec athletic association (oqaa). under their leadership, and the leadership of dr. richard moriarty, the department?s first athletic director, assumption?s athletics program blossomed, and as a result our intercollegiate teams were born at a rate of nearly one per year. prior to joining the oqaa, the history of purple raider/lancer athletics can be traced as far back as the early 1900?s when basketball and football teams at assumption college competed against colleges from detroit in friendly scrimmages. in 1960-61, women?s sports arrived on campus under the leadership of sis thompson. coach thompson initially coached the women?s basketball team before moving over to volleyball and leading the women to their first provincial championship in 1967. since its inception into collegiate athletics, women?s sports have continued to excel and develop, and in 2011 the lancer women?s basketball team made history by capturing their very first national championship in front of a capacity crowd at the st. denis centre. over the last half a century, the lancers have truly developed into a national powerhouse. the department added such sports as hockey, swimming, fencing, curling, archery, soccer, track & field, and badminton just to name a few before paring down to the seventeen teams we have today. our teams have captured either provincial and/or national championships in a variety of sports including basketball, track & field, volleyball, hockey, and football, and have had countless student-athletes recognized as conference all-stars, all-canadians, and academic all-canadians. today, as we embark into another era of canadian university sport, lancer athletics continues to prosper. we are extremely proud of all of our past and present student-athletes who excel in both the classroom and on the playing field. our current programs continue to build upon our past and look to bring an exciting and successful future. to see a complete list of of our all-time award winners, please click here. to view the university of windsor sports hall of fame inductees, please click here. team championships baseball
