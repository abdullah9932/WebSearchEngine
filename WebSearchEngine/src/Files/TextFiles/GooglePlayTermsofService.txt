(d) price changes. when you purchase a subscription, you will initially be charged at the rate applicable at the time of your agreement to subscribe. if the price of the subscription increases later, google will notify you. the increase will apply to the next payment due from you after the notice, provided that you have been given at least 10 days' prior notice before the charge is made. if you are given less than 10 days' prior notice, the price increase will not apply until the payment after the next payment due. if you do not wish to pay the increased price for a subscription, you may cancel the subscription as described in the cancellations section of these terms, and you will not be charged further amounts for the subscription, provided you have notified us before the end of the current billing period. where the provider increases the price of a subscription and consent is required, google may cancel your subscription unless you agree to the new price. if your subscription is cancelled and you later decide to re-subscribe, you will be charged at the then current subscription rate. 4. rights and restrictions license to use content. after completing a transaction or paying
