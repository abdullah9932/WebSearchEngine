how twitter ads work skip to main content business how twitter ads work we want to show you ads that you find interesting and useful. here's an overview of how twitter ads work, why you see certain ads, your privacy settings, and other options. what are twitter ads? you may see different kinds of ads on twitter, including promoted ads, follower ads, and trend takeover. we may show these ads to you when you are logged in or logged out of twitter. they are clearly marked with a ?promoted? icon. you can interact with most promoted content in much the same way as organic content. if you follow, like, or retweet content on twitter, including promoted content, your followers may see your name associated with that content. why you see certain twitter ads your activity on twitter, the information you provide to twitter, and our relationships with ad partners all help make promoted content more relevant for you. when you use twitter to follow, tweet, search, view, or interact with tweets or twitter accounts, we may use these actions to customize twitter ads for you. for example, if you search for a specific term, we may show you promoted content related to that topic. we also might customize ads using other information about you, such as your profile information; your mobile device location (if location features are turned on); your ip address; or the apps installed on your device. this helps us show you local ads and other ads that you might prefer. twitter may also personalize ads based on information that twitter and our affiliates collect and that our ad partners share with us, such as a hashed email address, a mobile device identifier, or browser-related information (a browser cookie id). this helps twitter display ads about things you?ve already shown interest in from brands and businesses that you may like. for example, you could receive a promoted ad about a deal or promotion from a business whose website you frequent, or email newsletter you subscribe to. you could also see this business as a follower ad in one of your "who to follow" suggestions. learn more about your privacy controls for personalized ads. managing your privacy settings we're committed to offering you meaningful privacy choices. if you don't want twitter to show you interest-based ads on and off of twitter, there are several ways to turn off this feature: using your twitter settings, visit the "personalization and data settings" and adjust the "personalize ads" setting. if you're on web, you can visit the digital advertising alliance?s consumer choice tool at optout.aboutads.info to opt-out of seeing interest-based advertising from twitter in your current browser. on ios 13 and earlier only, if you don't want twitter to show you interest-based ads in twitter for ios on your current mobile device, enable the ?limit ad tracking?
