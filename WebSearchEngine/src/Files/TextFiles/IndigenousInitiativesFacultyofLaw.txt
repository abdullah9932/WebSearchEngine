< back to homepage uwindsor home faculty of law indigenous initiatives indigenous initiatives boozhoo, ske:noh, hello, bonjour, windsor law sits on the traditional territory of the three fires confederacy of first nations, comprised of the ojibway, the odawa, and the potawatomi. we are ensuring that indigenous legal orders are fully acknowledged and respected in our teaching, research and community engagement. there is an abundance of indigenous-specific courses in our faculty of law curriculum, including a mandatory first-year course on indigenous legal orders and several upper-year options, including indigenous law camps. we also have an indigenous legal orders institute and an elder-in-residence program. we have a vibrant and growing community of indigenous and m?tis students, faculty and staff, and warmly welcome applications from prospective students. i invite you to explore these web pages and get in touch with us should you have any questions. we look forward to hearing from you. most recently, we have developed an indigenous pre-law skills-based training program, led by our indigenous faculty. the intensive five-day training is a useful stepping stone to our faculty and we welcome your participation. thank you for your interest in windsor law. miigwetch/nia:wen. beverly jacobs, professor and associate dean (academic) wissam aoun, professor admissions indigenous
