no, they are not required. however, the university of windsor and windsor-essex county health unit (wechu) highly recommend their use to better establish close contacts based on proximity within a classroom/lab setting. providing this information to the office of health & safety in advance may eliminate the need for students to self-isolate who were not within a close proximity to the infected individual. do i assign the seating or do i let students choose? given that students may have various reasons for choosing where they prefer to sit in a classroom (based on their visual or auditory acuity, mobility, or simply wanting to sit near to people they know), it is recommended that students be able to choose their own seats. upon choosing their seats, it is further recommended that they continue sitting in their same seats for the duration of the semester so that the seating plan remains intact. depending on the circumstances, assigning students to seats may result in a lot of extra work for instructors and inconvenience a number of students, particularly if they need to change seats to attend back-to-back classes in the same classroom, or if students require accommodations to sit in particular areas of the classroom. how can i quickly and easily obtain the seat number for where students are sitting within the classroom? there are countless ways of doing this, some of which may be easier than others, depending on one?s comfort with technology. one option is to share two links with your students via blackboard or in an email. the first link is the url address that directs students to the seating chart that corresponds with the classroom in which you are teaching. this link can be derived from the room seating maps presented at the bottom of this page. from there, ask students to identify their seat number by counting the number of seats from the aisle and the number of rows they are from the top or the bottom of the classroom. the second link can be to a google sheet or shared microsoft excel spreadsheet that has every student?s name listed in one column and an empty column next to it titled ?seat number.? then you simply ask the students to go to the google sheet or shared excel spreadsheet and ask them to enter their seat number next to their name. instructors can download their class rosters for each class/lab through student.uwindsor.ca. this job aid provides instruction on the process. note: please be sure to remove the column with uwinid numbers from any shared files. once all (or at least, most) students have entered their seat numbers, the instructor can then upload the spreadsheet and corresponding seating chart to health & safety using the following web form. a second option could simply involve you displaying the seating chart diagram on the projection screen in the classroom and asking students to identify where they are sitting. from there, you could ask them to report this information back to you using a one-question online assessment through blackboard, or using the poll or quiz functions of student engagement software such as mentimeter or kahoot! (among others). from there, you can export the results of the assessment/poll/quiz into a spreadsheet, which can then be uploaded to the form alongside the seating chart file, as explained above. a third option, for those who may be less tech savvy, could also involve you displaying the seating chart diagram on the projection screen in the classroom and asking students to identify where they are sitting. however, in this case, you could ask them write their name and seat number on a slip of paper that they submit to you at the end of class. you may wish to print the following template document for students to use for this purpose. to help ensure physical distancing, you could collect this information using a small box(es) or gift bag(s) near the entrance(s)/exit(s) to the classroom. from there, the instructor or ga/ta can populate the seat information into the class roster spreadsheet and upload it to the system following the same instructions as above. to facilitate the creation of these seating plans, instructors direct students to choose a spot within the classroom/lab that they will use for the duration of the semester. the instructor (or their ta) will then document their numbered position based on seating charts. a seating chart for every classroom (with fixed seating) where instruction will be taking place is available for download below. for classes not listed, instructors should number seats from left to right, closest (front) row to back. instructors can download their class roster for each class/lab through student.uwindsor.ca. this job aid provides instruction on the process. once the table is downloaded, instructors should add a column for seating position and enter the corresponding number for each student. repeat this process for all classes and labs. the rosters are to be uploaded to health & safety through the following form or at: uwindsor.ca/seatingchart for this protocol to be effective, seat assignments are permanent and for the duration of the semester. if at any point seating arrangements need to change, a new listing must be created and submitted. for labs, it is recommended that faculty create groups that remain together for the semester. details regarding these groups can be included on the submitted listing. this information will assist wechu with close contact determinations. seating charts (listed alphabetically by building) armouries building am b15 am b22 am b31 am b32 am b36 am 110 am 132 am 205 am 206 am 207 am 244 biology building bb 103 bb 113 bb 121 bb 223 bb 301 bb 303-b bb 305 bb 322 centre for creative arts fw 102 fw 107 fw 111 centre for engineering innovation cei 1100 cei 1101/1102 cei 1126 cei 1189 cei 1193 cei 2100 cei 2101 cei 2102 cei 2103 cei 2104 cei 2105 a cei 2191 cei 2220 chrysler hall north chn g100 chn g125 chn g133 cn 1137 cn 1186 cn 2173 chrysler hall south chs 51 chs 53 chs 66-1 chs 263 chs 265a chs 278 chs 294 dillon hall dh 253 dh 254 dh 255 dh 256 dh 264 dh 265 dh 350 dh 352 dh 353 dh 354 dh 355 dh 359 dh 361 dh 364 dh 365 dh 366 dh 367 dh 368 education building ed 1011 ed 1120 ed 1121 ed 1122 ed 1123 ed 1125 ed 1127 ed 2222 ed 2223 ed 2226 erie hall er studio a er 1114 er 1115 er 1118 er 1120 er 2123 er 2125 er 2127 er 2130 er 2137 er 3107 er 3119 er 3123 essex hall eh b-16 eh b-18 eh b-24 eh b-74 eh b-76 eh 105 eh 109 eh 122 eh 160/152 eh 172-1 eh 172-3 eh 173-1 eh 173-3 eh 173-6 eh 182 eh 186 eh 189 eh 189-3 eh 189-5 eh 189-6 eh 235 eh 287 eh 288-1 human kinetics building hk 140 hk 142 hk 143 hk 144 hk 145 jackman dramatic art centre jc 100 jc 102 jc 103 jc 106 lambton tower lt 9118 law building lw 305 leddy library ll g101a maintenance building mb 3106 mb 3108 mb 3112 mb 3129 memorial hall mh 101 mh 105 mh 109 mh 201 mh 214 mh 301 mh 302 mh 311 mh 312 odette building ob b02 ob b03 ob b04 ob b06 ob b14 ob b19 ob b20 ob 104 ob 108 ob 110 ob 112 ob 207 ob 210 ob 212 ob 507 toldo centre for education tc 100 tc 102 tc 104 tc 200 tc 202 tc 204 tc 212/214 share tweet save share tweet save contact us university directory accessibility news services for media uwindsor mobile apps terms & conditions policies manage uwin account emergency services for students follow us on twitter follow us on facebook follow us on linkedin follow us on flickr follow us on youtube follow us on instagram
