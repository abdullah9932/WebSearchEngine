11, 2022 school of creative arts, university of windsor link to registration form the mayday group (mdg) functions as an international think tank of music educators that aims to identify, critique, and change taken-for-granted patterns of professional activity, polemical approaches to method and philosophy, and educational politics and public pressures that threaten effective practice and critical communication in music education. the mayday group holds annual colloquia based on the group's action ideals aimed at furthering critical thought in the music education profession. annual colloquia explore and interrogate a given mdg action ideal; each year, the mayday group selects a different higher education institution from across the globe to host this prestigious conference. mdg members include musicians, music educators, social and cultural theorists from over 25 countries. this year they have selected the university of windsor's school of creative arts because of the reputation of our music education program as a site for critical pedagogy; conference dates are june 8-11, 2022. important weblinks to the mayday group and mayday group colloquium 33 register to attend the conferece [weblink] https://www.uwindsor.ca/soca/408/registration-form-colloquium-33 the mayday group [weblink] www.maydaygroup.org/ mayday group colloquium 33 [weblink] mdg33.weebly.com/ conference hotels [weblin] mdg33.weebly.com/hotels.html this year's colloquium aims are twofold: 1) presenters are to interrogate the implications that the mdg action ideal on technology and digital media has for music teaching and learning, and 2) presenters will also engage with the event's theme/call, entitled social media for good or evil in music learning and teaching. as research on the impact of social media is relatively new in music education, discussions will contribute to the creation and mobilization of emerging knowledge within the field; during colloquium 33, participating music scholars and educators will co-construct and share new understandings of how digital technology and communication both challenge and offer new possibilities for music education. after 22 months in covid isolation, scholars and educators are ready to connect in-person and to critically reflect on what they have been learning -- and still need to learn -- about how humans and technologies interact in music learning and teaching. spoken papers are 30 minutes long followed by 15 minutes of facilitated discussion. questions guiding this year's colloquium include but are not limited to: 1) how do social media, and social network sites enable and support music learning in diverse contexts? and the converse -- what underlying structures inhibit or negatively affect the same? 2) how meaningful is the notion of participatory culture for thinking about social media and music learning? 3) how are issues such as communication, mass self-communication, power, democracy, and identity negotiated in a networked society and what are the implications for music learning and making? 4) how does the business of social media support or exploit the ways in which musicians learn and interact? 5) what is the role of digital labour and creation of social media's value in music learning and production? participants and participant-researchers include tenured and nontenured academics, graduate students, undergraduate students, and members of the public. based on past colloquia, we anticipate 75-100 participants and participant-presenters. updated: march 29, 2022 tags: mayday group music education conference share tweet save daily news student ensembles returning to in-person performance in-person performances returning to scholarship competition classical concert boasts campus connections exhibition calls for submissions from disability community fast fashion to come under scrutiny of science and sustainability more upcoming soca events uwindsor jazz cabaret fri, 04/08/2022 - 19:30 mfa group show - traces mon, 04/11/2022 - 09:00 mfa group show - traces tue, 04/12/2022 - 09:00 luminous flux ii tue, 04/12/2022 - 14:30 luminous flux ii tue, 04/12/2022 - 14:30 more tweets by uwindsorsoca share tweet save contact us university directory accessibility news services for media uwindsor mobile apps terms & conditions policies manage uwin account emergency services for students follow us on twitter follow us on facebook follow us on linkedin follow us on flickr follow us on youtube follow us on instagram
