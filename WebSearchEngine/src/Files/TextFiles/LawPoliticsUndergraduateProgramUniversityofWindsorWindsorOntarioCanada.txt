wouldn?t trade my time in the law & politics program for anything. the incredible professors i met and experiences i had paved the way for my path forward. working on research with some of our professors inspired me to aim for a career in academia. i also took advantage of the courses taught in french at the faculty and am currently taking almost all of my law courses at mcgill in french, which i don?t think i would have been able to do had it not been for the vocabulary and writing skills gained in those french-language political science classes." ?milie weidl law & politics connect
